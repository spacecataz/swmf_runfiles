This folder contains a new IMF file for the Galaxy 15 event that is also ballistically propagated ACE data, similar to the SWPC test file, but is longer and also contains electron temperature data collected from wind.

The PARAM file is currently configured as a 2.0 IB RLM run that is otherwise very similar to the standard SWPC configuration - note that runs with it have been crashing.
